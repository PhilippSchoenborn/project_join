                request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, provided we
                have no other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law
                retention periods); in the latter case, deletion will occur after these reasons no longer apply.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>General Information on the Legal Bases of Data Processing on This Website</h4>
            <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6(1)(a) DSGVO or
                Art. 9(2)(a) DSGVO if special data categories are processed according to Art. 9(1) DSGVO. In the case of
                explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based
                on Art. 49(1)(a) DSGVO. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to access information on your
                end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on ยง 25(1) TDDG.
                The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract or
                for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data based on Art. 6(1)(b) DSGVO.
                Furthermore, we process your data if necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6(1)(c)
                DSGVO. The data processing may also be based on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) DSGVO.
                Information on the relevant legal bases in each individual case can be found in the following paragraphs
                of this privacy policy.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Recipients of Personal Data</h4>
            <p>In the context of our business activities, we work with various external parties. In some cases, it is
                necessary to transfer personal data to these external parties. We only pass on personal data to external
                parties if it is necessary in the context of contract fulfillment if we are legally obliged to do so
                (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f)
                DSGVO in the transfer, or if another legal basis allows the data transfer. When using processors, we
                only pass on personal data of our customers based on a valid processing contract. In the case of joint
                processing, a contract for joint processing is concluded.</p>

                BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED
                PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE
                YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE ASSERTION, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF
                LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21(1) DSGVO).
                IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY
                TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO

            <h4>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h4>
            <p>In the event of violations of the DSGVO, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a
                supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or

            </p>
        </div>
        <div>

                feasible.</p>
        </div>
        <div>

                your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of the data processing and, if
                applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data at any time. For this purpose, as well as for
                further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Right to Restriction of Processing</h4>
            <div class="text-container">
                <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this
                    purpose,
                    you can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following
                    cases:
                </p>
                <ul>

                        processing of your personal data.</li>
                    <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data

                        of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
                        personal data instead of deletion.</li>
                    <li>If you have lodged an objection under Art. 21(1) DSGVO, a balance must be struck between your
                        and our interests. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have
                        the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data - apart from its storage - may
                    only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or
                    for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important
                    public interest of the European Union or a member state.</p>

                    (permanent cookies) stored on your device. Session cookies are automatically deleted after your

                <p>Cookies can be first-party cookies (set by us) or third-party cookies (set by third-party companies).
                    Third-party cookies enable the integration of certain services provided by third-party companies
                    within websites (e.g., cookies for processing payment services).
                </p>
                <p>Cookies serve various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary as certain website functions
                    would not work without them (e.g., the shopping cart function or displaying videos). Other cookies
                    may be used to evaluate user behavior or for advertising purposes.
                </p>
                <p>Cookies necessary for the electronic communication process, the provision of certain functions you

                    cookies and comparable recognition technologies has been requested, processing is based exclusively

                on this data without your consent. The processing of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) DSGVO if your
                request is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of
                pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the
                effective handling of the requests addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) DSGVO) or on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a)
                DSGVO) if this has been requested; the consent can be revoked at any time. The data you send to us via

                the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been processed). Mandatory
